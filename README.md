# Practical Tutorial: Clustering
 
For those interested in clustering, and specifically in the most common algorithms, hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering, here is a practical guide that I think many of you will find useful. It was created during my stay in [Prof. Rainer KÃ¶nig lab](https://www.uniklinikum-jena.de/infektionsmedizin/Forschung/Modelling.html) and represents my updated version of the lab's tutorial for the annual R course. My solution for the tasks is provided as an attached .R file. Enjoy!
