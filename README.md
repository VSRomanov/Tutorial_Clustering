# Practical Tutorial: Clustering
 
For those interested in clustering, and specifically in the most common algorithms, hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering, here is a practical guide that I think many of you will find useful. It was created during my stay in [Prof. Rainer KÃ¶nig lab](https://www.uniklinikum-jena.de/infektionsmedizin/Forschung/Modelling.html) and represents my updated version of the lab's tutorial for the annual R course. My solution for the tasks is provided as an attached .R file. Enjoy!

**1. Data**

For the tutorial, a dataset with 4,345 genes and 43 experimental samples is used. It is a real study that investigated the expression of E.coli in aerobic and anaerobic media. For details, see [*Covert, M.W. et al. (2004). Nature, 429, 92-96*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02456). 

First, download the gene expression table 'covert.withsymbols.log.Dec05.tab' to your diretory.
